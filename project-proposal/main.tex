  Reconstructing human hair is one of the most challenging yet critical process in rendering photorealistic digital human. Unlike other parts of the human body, human hair is highly detailed and often intertwined together. Therefore, it's difficult to use traditional photogrammetry method to reconstruct its structure.

  Before machine learning is used in this field, artists often hand crafted splines on skulls to represent hair strands. Each strand is then textured and rendered to mimic the hair volume. This workflow requires a lot of experience as it's non-trivial for artists to infer the final render result from hair stand splines. To reduce the workload and improve the accuracy of hair reconstruction, machine learning models are used to generate hair strand from captured photos.
